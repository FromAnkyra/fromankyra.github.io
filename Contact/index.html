        <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
        <p>I cannot always be found in places that other humans can, but I do try. Here are a couple of places you can reach me, if you need to. As a general rule, if you find someone going by the 'nym fromankyra online, it's probably me.</p>
        <!--TODO: fix whatever the fuck is up with h2. I'm gonna create some more content.-->
        <h2>twitter</h2>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/fromankyra">@fromankyra</a></p>
        <p>My main existence happens on twitter. However, I've been known to softblock people if they follow more than a thousand people, or have no mutuals in common or interactions prior to following me.</p>
        <h2>email</h2>
        <p>fromankyra [at] gmail [dot] com</p>
        <p>Email is the most reliable way to reach me. I try to reply within a few days.</p>
        <h2>github</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/FromAnkyra/fromankyra.github.io">github</a></p>
        <p>I do exist on github, although it's a whole lot of private repos, mostly. Maybe things will happen, someday.</p>
