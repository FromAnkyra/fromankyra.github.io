        <h1>My Thoughts on the 2020 Hugo Award Ceremony</h1>
        <p>The Hugo Awards Ceremony happened recently! Based on when I end up feeling confident enough to post this, it may have been any time between yesterday, and three years ago.</p>
        <p>First off, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yGPBIQvs0Y&t=3834s">go watch it</a>. No, it's not the official version, yes, it has a snarky title, there is a reason for it which I will get to later.</p>
        <p>The ballot this year was amazing. With categories like Best Fan Artist, for which I had strong opinions (yay Elise Matthesen!! Her artwork is amazing, and I hope that I can someday wear some of her artwork) choosing second place was a Task. Seriously, though, what a ballot. I'm supposed to choose a favourite between the novellas? And when my favourite doesn't win, the only thing I can focus on is:
            <ul>
                <li>How ridiculously adorably happy Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone look</li>
                <li>How amazing This Is How You Lose The Time War was</li>
                <li>How fucking incredible that acceptance speech was</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I cannot begin to go into how powerful almost every acceptance speech was. Or, I could, but that would involve rewatching a rather long video, and would probably end up with me going on about them for far longer than is reasonable for what I intend to be a reasonably short post. Some highlights, though, besides the aforementioned El-Mohtar/Gladstone speech (which I will go into later) follow:</p>
        <p>Rebecca F. Kuang began the evening with one hell of a (as it happened, prophetic) speech calling out the science fiction industry and community for its sexism and racism. If it is now a tradition to have Astounding Award winners call out where this community fails and where we need to do better, I am here for it. This was amazing, thank you.</p>
        <p>Bogi Takács and John Picacio both, in their speeches, highlighted other people in their category, pulling the focus on the community and just how many amazing people are in it. Takács's stood out, I think, especially due to eir eligible work being partly compiling databases of works by marginalised authors. (Tfw someone does the thing thy were nominated for in their acceptance speech.)</p>
        <p>SPEAKING OF which, you'd think that would happen, like, once - and then Jeannette Ng wins best related work for her Astounding Award speech from last year, and... somehow manages to top it this year. Apparently, not only can speeches can has sequels, but they can be just as powerful, and fun-hat containing, as the first. Honestly, the only argument against nominating it for best related work <em>next</em> year is that I want whole collection of acceptance speeches from this year to be nominated.</p>
        <p>This post was supposed to be in chronological order, but then it ran away from me. There is more to be said about these speeches, so here's a speedrun of opinions: What Amal and Max said about letters and the future haunts me almost as much as Elise Matthesen's "Art is a relay race". Neil Gaiman's tribute to Terry Pratchett was frankly beautiful and should have had some space after it to let it sink in. It wasn't an acceptance speech, but Mary Robinette Kowal's introduction of the nominees was beautiful, well performed, and fit in with the various points made by the speeches perfectly.</p>
        <p>I'm going to take some time now to squee about one of the works that won. First off, Emergency Skin. Wow. Given <a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/">The Ones Who Stay And Fight</a>, I should probably not be surprised that N.K. Jemisin can write a utopia that feels both earned and believable, but wow, this story. I hope for it, and I want to fight for it. </p>
        <p>It frustrates me no end that I cannot go on about each of these amazing people without referencing those who would hold them back. Don't worry, even the privileged were able to see those cruel remnants, as they were personnified in one fuckwit of a toastmaster (And his sidekick!). Better writers than me have explained just quite cruel this fellow's actions were. (No, not careless. That implies unintentional hurt, and I can't believe this was unintentional.) Here are a few:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>There are more, but this post is already rather long. I'm not going to say that this community doesn't have issues, and big ones. Small places reflect both the best and the worst of the ones they are subsets of. But let's spend some time on the phenomenal work some of its members are making. <a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/07/31/announcing-the-2020-hugo-award-winners/">Here is this year's ballot.</a> Read the works. Watch the video I linked to at the start. Have a cat picture.</p>
