        <h1>Spinning Wheel Adventures</h1>
        <p>I recently entered a shop in Ulus and came out of it a day later with an apparently working spinning wheel. "Froman! Did you, who has never used a spinning wheel, buy one on a whim with no way to make it work?" Well, sort of. I did use the intervening day to ask my friends who know about this stuff if it would be usable by me, and I did check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if_cNDFr-xs">this video</a> and I didn't technically buy it (my father bought it for me). Still, using and caring for a spinning wheel is a fairly daunting task, and I thought documenting the whole prrocess may be interesting both as in an archival sense and for anyone wanting to do something similar.</p>
