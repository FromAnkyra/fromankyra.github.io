        <h2 class="book-title">Network Effect - A Murderbot Novel</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Martha Wells</h3>
        <p>Lookie! It's the first Murderbot novel! And good god does Martha Wells take advantage of that extended wordcount. There's always a <em>lot</em> that happens in a Murderbot story, and more words means more happening! It's not a case of jamming multiple stories together, as such, more that the story is BIGGER. Murderbot gets the chance to get MORE character development, and to form or explore meaningful relationships with MORE characters than it has previously. As always, Murderbot delights me in its narration, interaction with humans that it just doesn't understand (not to mention other bots). The novel was also a refreshing look at some of Murderbot's unreliable narration, which has been implied, but, well. When you have an unreliable narrator, I sometimes have trouble seeing when they're unreliable.</p>
        <p>This was a lot of fun, and a lot of comfort. MORE, please.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">The City We Became</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by N.K. Jemisin</h3>
        <p>Three years ago, N.K. Jemisin was nominated for her short story A City Born Great. She's used it as a jumping off point for her new novel, The City We Became, and, fuck. What a book. It is glorious, fun, and hopeful, even as it acknowledges the awfulness of the world as it is (well, pre-covid).</p> 
        <p>The blurb at the back says that this book takes Lovecraft and makes it something unique, but I think there's more to it than that - this book is the Anti-Lovecraft. In Lovecraft's work, the evil is the unknown, the incomprehensible. This book knows the enemy. The enemy is the white woman who calls the cop on Brown boys simply for existing. It's the "ironic" fascists who try to invade progressive spaces. More than anything, it's gentrification, that strips all of the personality from a place, and all the people, too. The enemy is Lovecraft himself, with his hatred for cities and anyone who didn't look like him.</p>
        <p>I can see this book winning a Hugo in any year, but the sheer glee I have to be able to vote for it after some of the clusterfucks during the Hugos and Retro Hugos this past year.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">The Care and Feeding of Waspish Widows</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Olivia Waite</h3>
        <p>I don't read much Romance Fiction, and this is the sort of book that makes me wonder why. It is incredibly comforting to know, when I open a book, that everything will turn out fine, and that the characters will be happy. Within those constraints, this book manages to say something powerful about safety, change, and people who want to prevent that. This story is set in the same universe as the Lady's Guide to Celstial Mechanic's, and stars some of the characters from it. The stakes, though, are different, because the main characters have different backgrounds. The worst thing that could happen to these ladies isn't losing their chance at doing what they love, but potentially worse.</p>
        <p>This book is a powerful examination of what it means to be a woman (both straight or not), a wife, and a widow within the time which it is set. Both the lack of power and the relative privilege of all the characters is examined. Perhaps this might seem anachronistic (the politics didn't surprise me, but the description of the dildo did), but, look. This is a historical romance author, she knows this setting better than I ever will.</p>
        <p>That said, I wouldn't call this a perfect novel. I don't enjoy sex scenes, and that's on me, but it does mean I had to skip some passages from the book. However, I will say that the main villain of the story was perhaps slightly too diabolical, even as the characters tried to examine her motivations.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, though, I'm not the target audience for this, so take anything I say with a grain of salt.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">Harrow the Ninth</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Tamsyn Muir</h3>
        <p>Well... The ending was good? Actually, scratch that, the last couple hundred pages were fucking great, keeping the tone of the first one and building on it, through a look at Harrow's personality, and the rich world that Muir has built. There are some lovely subversions of expectation, and the one criticism I have is that it should have wrapped up sliiightly more neatly and given us more time to spend with the characters after we'd learned their motivations.</p>
        <p>And then there's the first three hudred pages. I - The thing is, I get a lot of what this book was trying to do. The whole second person thing makes sense, and more when you realise the third book will probably be in the third person. The non-sequiturs and the bits that just don't mesh together have an unspoken promise to get to the point, and eventually the book does. But three hundred pages is a lot to get through, and when I'm readng the sequel to a book known as a love letter to fanfiction, I don't want it to feel like homework. I don't think this book is less like fanfiction than it's predecessor as such, but to be honest, if it had been fanfiction, I'd probably not have gotten to the good bits.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">Or What You Will</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Jo Walton</h3>
        <p>I got about a third of a way through this book and started begging friends to read it because it's so GOOD and I NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT OMG, so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to confine a review to a couple paragraphs.</p>
        <p>This book is about the death of the author, retellings of stories, stories growing, the author as a figure, fandom and it's evolution. It is also probably about so much more than that, but this is where my brain was, and this is what I picked up on.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I would not call this book cutting edge, at least on what it says about the sf community. It is, by necessity, dated, if only because of how long it takes to write and publish a book. It is definitely aware of this - the book is very firmly set in the summer of 2018 (well, the "contemporary" portions, at least), and the character through who's eyes we see has some rather outdated views, despite working on them. This is, I think, not only intentional, but necessary - to look forward, we also need to understand what we're leaving behind, why we loved them in the first place (and why we're going to keep loving them) and why we need to move on.</p>
        <p>This book was powerful, and familiar, and needed. Thank you.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">The True Queen</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Zen Cho</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, all you need is a cute sapphic fluffy fantasy. It helps, that in this case, the fantasy was tremendously well written with engaging characters and set in fantasy regency England. It also helps that it's gay. I don't have much to say about this book, aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and something cute and lighthearted was what I needed after a big disappointment followed by an utter gutpunch of a book.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">Sal and Gabi Break the Universe</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Carlos Hernandez</h3>
        <p>Sal and Gabi gave me the Goblin Emperor feeling of "I could keep reading this for days and just feel like I'm getting hugged". It's funny, it's lighthearted, it is unabashedly, unapologetically kind. It is also very much a kid's book, which meant that I got through it in about three hours and it was over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but did mean that it was gone much sooner than I would have wanted. Not to say it was badly paced - I found the pacing unusual, but also very comforting - just that it was short.</p>
        <p>The characters in this book manage to be teenagers in the way that I remember being one - the "mean girl" is mean, but in a realistic way where she's just a bit of a dick and it makes her less popular. People get to be friends, or friendly, without massive politics, despite the existence of bullies and the like. It also, while focusing on kids, very much avoids the "adults are useless" trope (and I love the adults in this book so much, with their beautiful queer families). Essentially, this book was beautifully refreshing, and I will probably check out more Rick Riordan presents books, despite not being the target audience</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">Jade War</h2>
        <h3 class="author">by Fonda Lee</h3>
        <p>This book is not a comfort read. It is a fucking good read, but god is it harrowing. Characters you love will die, characters you hate (but occasionally suspect may have a point) will get lucky break after lucky break, and the dramatic irony reaches shakespearean levels. The amount of times this book had characters in places where they <em>thought</em> they'd be satisfied but turns out they're more miserable than ever... On the other hand, if you are emotionally up for that, then I heartily recommend this book.</p>
        <p>As in Jade City, I got very attached to a lot of the characters, despite my conflicted thoughts about their motivations and actions. I have, in the past, said I don't like grimdark - I'm not sure if this series counts as grimdark, but if it does, then it is the exception that proves the rule. I'm not convinced it would have worked in the hands of a less skilled writer, or in a world that wasn't built as well.</p>
        <p>Part of the aforementioned skilful worldbuilding in this book is the very present passage of time. In this sense, it reminds me of the Alpennia books, although that series takes a slightly different approach. Instead of setting the story strongly around yearly events, Jade War makes a point of telling us how long ago plot events happened. This is probably, bar Alpennia, the best execution I've seen of the passage of time in a story.</p>
        <p>I will read the third book of this series when it comes out. But good lord, I'll probably have to read some nice fluff just before. And after. Maybe during.</p>
